In my ICS 212 class, we spent the whole semester learning the C programming language and were tasked to create a user interface friendly program. This program took the users bank account records and would store them into an ordered linked list. The program would print a menu showing many options for the user to select. It would restrict duplicate account numbers. Once the user quits the program it would save the linked list data into a txt file. The program then reads all the data from the txt file and stores them in an ordered linked list each time the user runs the program. 

Individually each student had to create their own Bank Record program. 


In this project I learned so many new things. It was my first time programming in C, using a MakeFile, TXT file, Linked lists, linking numerous object and c codes, and using VIM. This experience was definetly hectic and stressful but I enjoyed seeing it finally come together in the end.

Here is a snippet of my code showing how I was able to take the exact address input from the user:
```cpp
void getAddress(char addy[], int length)
{
    char address;
    int index = 0;
    int end = 0;
    char prev_char;
    if (debugmode == 1)
    {
        printf("!!!! DEGBUGMODE!!!!\n");
        printf("The getAddress function was called\n");
        printf("The parameters are the char array[] and the address: %d\n", length);

    printf("Please enter your address:\n");
    printf("Please enter the 'enter button' twice at the end of your address\n");
    while (index < length -1 && address != EOF && end != 1)
    {
        address = getchar();
        if (address == '\n')
        {
            if (prev_char == '\n')
            {
                end = 1;
            }
        }
        addy[index] = address;
        prev_char = address;
        index++;
    }
    addy[index] = '\0';
    printf("The inputted address is: %s\n" , addy);
}
```
