<pre>
In my ICS 212 class, we spent the whole semester learning the C language and creating a user interface friendly program. This program took the users bank account records and would store them into an ordered linked list. It would restrict duplicate account numbers. Once the user quits the program it would save the linked list data into a txt file. The program then reads all the data from the txt file and stores them in an ordered linked list each time the user runs the program. 

Individually each student had to create their own Bank Record program. 


In this project I learned so many new things. It was my first time programming in C, using a MakeFile, TXT file, Linked lists, linking numerous object and c codes, and using VIM. This experience was definetly hectic and stressful but I enjoyed seeing it finally come together in the end.
