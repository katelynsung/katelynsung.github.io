In my ICS 212 class, we spent the whole semester learning the C language and creating a user interface friendly program. This program took the users bank account records and would store them into an ordered linked list. It would restrict duplicate account numbers. Once the user quits the program it would save the linked list data into a txt file. The program then reads all the data from the txt file and stores them in an ordered linked list each time the user runs the program. 


This project included many of my firsts; first time programming in C, using a MakeFile, TXT file, Linked lists, linking numerous object and c codes, and using VIM.


Here is some code that illustrates how the Menu was created:


void getAddress(char addy[], int length)
{
    char address;
    int index = 0;
    int end = 0;
    char prev_char;
    if (debugmode == 1)
    {
        printf("!!!! DEGBUGMODE!!!!\n");
        printf("The getAddress function was called\n");
        printf("The parameters are the char array[] and the address: %d\n", length);
    }
    printf("Please enter your address:\n");
    printf("Please enter the 'enter button' twice at the end of your address\n");
    while (index < length -1 && address != EOF && end != 1)
    {
        address = getchar();
        if (address == '\n')
        {
            if (prev_char == '\n')
            {
                end = 1;
            }
        }
        addy[index] = address;
        prev_char = address;
        index++;
    }
    addy[index] = '\0';
    printf("The inputted address is: %s\n" , addy);
}
