During the Summer for one month I contributed volunteering with 808 cleanups. 
We'd meet once a week at Pu`uo Kaimuki park and divide into groups. Each person would have their own responsibility in restoring the park. From stacking cement rocks to create a cleaner wall, remove trash, rocks, or trim trees. I usually had the responsibility of weeding out invasive species of weeds. That way it would make space for Native plants to prosper. 
```cpp
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
