summary: "In my ICS 212 class we worked the whole semester learning the C programming language and developed a user interface that keeps track of bank records. This system should take the user's input and store it until it is deleted by the user. Everytime the user exists the program all the records should be saved. When the program is run again, a the data on the sheet should be read and stored into a linked list."
