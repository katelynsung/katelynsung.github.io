During the Summer for one month I contributed volunteering with 808 cleanups. 
We'd meet once a week at Pu`uo Kaimuki park and divide into groups. Each person would have their own responsibility in restoring the park. From stacking cement rocks to create a cleaner wall, remove trash, rocks, or trim trees. I usually had the responsibility of weeding out invasive species of weeds. That way it would make space for Native plants to prosper.
