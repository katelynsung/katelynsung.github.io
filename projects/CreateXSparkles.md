summary: "CreateX Sparkle Fantasy"
---

I got an amazing oppurtunity taking a Augmented Virtual Reality class in the Fall. 

At UH West Oahu in their new Creative Media building, we were assigned to develop a CreateX project. My teammates Aaron McLean, Jingyi He, and I created an interactable sparkling fantasy experience. Using the platform Unity, we all worked on creating a fantasy experience. Aaron developed a sparkling ambiance that users could interact with, while Jingyi developed deer models from scratch through blender. With the camera body tracking, users could interact with the sparkles making it a fluttery and glittery interaction.

With these interactive experiences trending in places like TokyoLab, Van Gogh immersive experiences, etc, It was incredible being able to get a touch on how they are created.

This was actually my first time using Unity and taking a more creative computer science class. It was an outstanding experience and I enjoyed the CreateX project the most. This class made me realize there is more to the field of Computer Science than just a software engineer. I recently went to TeamLabs in Tokyo and found it so cool that my classmates and I were able to create almost the same experience. I want to apply what I learned and try to work on personal projects to develop cool TokyoLab-like experiences. Ideally, I want to get into the fashion tech field, creating high-tech commercials or using these projections and body trackers to make cool fashion shows and campaigns. It was surprising to see how creative my classmates were and if we spent more time on it, I'm sure we could have created a 'HawaiiLab' experience!
