## The Problem
In Hawai'i there is a heavy popularity in shell jewelry. Unfortunately, these pieces can be sold starting at $200. Which is super expensive and out of reach for college students. The overpriced jewelry limits college students from being able to enjoy natures gift in a fashion aspect. Jewelry can also be very restrictive with different sizes not fitting the way they would want it to fit.

## The Solution
The solution is to create a brand called where we ethically source Kona Abalone shells and create beautiful shell jewelry. Not only does this allow UH students to be able to rock shell jewelry at an affordable price, but it helps the local community with their business. This also targets the issue of recycling, helping our island. Students can place a customized order to find their perfect length and size of their jewelry, making the jewelry made to order.

## Mock Up Page Idea
For the website we will have the usual Nav Bar with the logo name, shopping chart, and instagram link. The shopping cart will link to a 'Place an Order' site. Where the use can place their order of the style, length of the chain, and color. They will also need to fill out their name and shipping address.
On the home page it will be a video of the glistening ocean presenting a background story of the brand. It will be about the problem of fashion affordability and feature the communities that the user is supporting by purchasing. 
There will be another page on the homescreen talking about the symbolism of Abalone shells. Which spiritually include: bringing guidance, calm emotions, strengthening love and harmony. The shells are a 'sacred symbol of the sea' (symbolism has been very popular about jewelry recently)
There will also be a button that is labeled 'shop styles' This will take the use to a link seeing the 3 different styles that they can choose from.
There will be one chocker necklace, a chain with a pearl necklace, and a adjustable bracelet.

## Case Idea
-User goes onto site, scrolls through homepage, reads the backround information and about the brand.

-User clicks 'Shope styles' button and browses through the different styles. 

-User clicks 'Place an Order' and fills out a form completing the name, shipping address, style, and chain length.

-User submits the order and a notification pops up with a confirmation such as 'Thank you for placing your order!'

## Beyond the Basics
-Have the user enter their credit card information and actually charge them

-take in user's email to send shipping confirmation and order details

-Allow users to leave reviews on their orders

-Have a page that shows 'jewelry on you' which previews an instagram page showing the buyers wearing them
