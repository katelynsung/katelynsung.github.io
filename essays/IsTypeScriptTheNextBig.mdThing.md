I just recently got to dip my feet into the new world of TypeScript. From my small experience of the languages Java and C, I can say there are a few things in TypeScript that I like much more. The structure of Java script seems to be a lot easier when writing functions. I appreciate not needing to create a main method every time like you would do in C and Java. When creating a function in TypeScript I also like how you need to initialize the type of return function at the beginning. This has made it easier and more organized for me. The hassle of having to type longer sentences such as 'System.out.println' has also been eliminated which makes printing things out more efficient. 

I learned a lot of new things that I still have to get used to and understand. There seem to be a lot of 'shortcuts' in initializing as well as the usage of special characters such as the back slashes. ES6 in particular is a language I still need to study to grasp the concept, I think it was difficult for me more than the beginner Type Script module. Overall with my limited knowledge I don't see why Type Script wouldn't be a good programming language. I think there are alot of benefits as it seems to be alot easier to organize and type faster. The elimination of the main method especially makes it seem a little easier. However only time will tell once I get more of a grasp to this language.

In terms of athletic software, I think it is very challenging to work under pressure. I think its super benefitial and set up to really help me when it comes to real life job oppurtunities and interviews. I have not had much experience having pressure to code in a certain amount of time, so I know these WODs will definetly be benefitial to my skills. I think this style of learning really will work out for me. In a way it feels like I am in an online class, but still getting to do some group work and practice real life situations. I think the WODs are setting us up for a prepared future. The WODs are definetly stressful since they are graded, but the fact that we have practice ones both online and inperson are so helpful. I am thankful to be able to get that much practice oppurtunities in, especially since the answers are reviewed at the end as well. I think it will take me some time to get used to this new language as well as being underpressure but I hope it will benefit me and motivate me.
