## So Far So Good?
In my ICS 314 class I have just been recently introduced to HTML. To start, I will say that It is a nice break from other coding languages and for loops. However I did not realize how messy HTML could be! So far I've done a few assignments in my class and wow the organization of the code can get really messy. I'm still having a lot of trouble between the usage of CSS and HTML. Sometimes I am duplicating things such as changing the padding in both the CSS and HTML, so I am still trying to understand how to use them and not overlap with eachother. The usage of containers also still confuse me. I seem to be putting numerous containers into another, but it does not make sense to me. HTML does excite me because it seems to be a more useful skill. Unlike other coding classes and languages where you just follow instructions to make something, HTML allows you to actually see and use the websites you create. This makes it more fun for me and it helps my hands on and visual learning process. I think being able to make websites is such an important skill to have so I have been practicing hard. In my class we have practice WODS which stand for the Work Out of the Day. These are timed quizes that are graded pass or fail. While I thought HTML is refreshing to learn and get away from loops, I failed my first HTML WOD. HTML and Bootstrap is so detailed, it is difficult to make sure everything is accurately placed and organized. 

## What is Bootstrap5?
Bootstrap is an open source framework that aids in creating websites and web apps faster. In my class we've recently been implementing the usage of Bootstrap and from the beginning I actually liked it! I was able to quickly search up icons such as Instagram, twitter, the shopping bag cart, and the search button. I found it super cool finding out the behind the scenes of making websites that have their social media links or even the shopping cart. I look at websites differently now, thinking about how easy some of them are to recreate, while others look too complex. Bootstrap also has the navbar. The navbar is the top section of a website, where is may say the brand Logo, have their social media links, and even their menu. I kind of learned how to make drop down menus that were in the navbar. This is just like when you're going on a clothing website and they have a header section that says 'Men' 'Women' 'Kids' 'Sale' and when you click on the word, a whole hidden list presents itself of different categories. In my honest opinion, at the moment I think Bootstrap is pretty confusing I am still figuring out and making many errors. But I also think that HTML and CSS are confusing as well. I think it's just this whole new language in general that is a big shift. I'm mixing all 3 of them up and the usage of it. While I do think that Bootstrap does take some time to getting used to, I can see that it is beneficial and makes developing websites more efficient. Instead of having to download images, shape them, and fit them to the top. It's nice that Bootstrap can easily have the navbar structure code and they have an abundance of commonly used icons that are easy to download. It seems like it provides 'shortcuts'. So with that being said, overall I think that Bootstrap is very important and It is worth to go through the struggling learning process in order to efficiently make websites.
