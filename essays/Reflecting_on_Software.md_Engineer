## Configuration Management
I got to learn and understand the concept of Configuration Management. This "attempts to identify and track all relevant elements of the configuration of a system, so that all possible errors can be identified, and possible errors can be identified, and possible solutions to the problems found. 

## The Three Configuration Management Problems
1. Double maintenece problem
2. The shared data problem
3.The simultaneous update problem 

These problems mainly occur when working in group projects. Previously people would email source codes back and fourth.
Solutions to these problems are GIT which is a distributed version control system. With this system, multiple people are able to work on the same source code and alter it by creating different branches. 
For my group project in ICS 314 we actively took advantage of a version control system called GitHub. This allowed us to work efficiently and effectively wihtout having any conflicts of duplicate files, or even accidentally deleting someone else's portion. I can definetly see myself using Configuration Management in the future for not just web applications. In another class I'm currently in we were working on creating a virtual experience using Unity. To ensure we were able to accurately update our project without the hassle of redownloading every small adjustment, we used Git as our version control system. So getting the experience for using Github and Git throughout this course allowed me to familiarize myself in a very important tool I can use for future projects.

## Coding Standards
Coding standards is a guidline that improves readability by ensuring a common look and feel regardless who wrote it. It removes and detects basic anti patterns or generic coding mistakes. There are different tools for different langauges that can automatically detect and fix errors automatically. 

Throughout my class I learned the efficiency of ESLint and ESLint Prettier. These organized and correctly formatted each line of code, making it more legible. It was handy how I could have my small errors be corrected with just one button. I noticed when working on my group project, since my team members and I all used ESLint in our source codes, being able to understand eachothers codes was effortless. Everything was legible especially with the organized indentations. 

I can see myself continue to use Coding standards. Prior to this class and incorporating plugins I had class that enforced a different type of coding standard. I would run the coding standard checker through my local terminal and it was satisfying to cleanup and fix all my formatting and indentations. This made me more aware of how beneficial and convenient coding standards were. I know this is an important concept to understand and incorporate for future projects for myself and when working with others.
