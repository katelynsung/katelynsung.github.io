## Introduction

The introduction and usage of AI has definitley made my learning habits and school a different experience than before it was introduced. While I'm not familiar with every AI platform, I've used ChatGPT the most. While I do think it provides as an outside source of help, sometimes I catch myself getting lazier as a result. In my ICS 314 class I did take advantage of using ChatGPT. Especially when I would be stuck with numerous errors and moments of 'how do I do this?' The usage of AI helped me alot in those portions. 

## 1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
I really liked how the WODs on the course site were structured. There were a lot of detailed instructions as well as a step by step video if you got stuck. For these homework assignments I hardly ever used AI. I think if anything if I was having format errors such as making an image more to the left I would use chatgpt to debug them for me. For these experiences I would mainly refer to the videos that the professors made whenever I got stuck. 

## 2. In-class Practice WODs
For the practice WODs I never used any AI tools. Since they were only practice I would try my best to test my own skills. I would just make sure that if I wasn't able to finish the practice WOD, I would make sure to get the correct answer and practice them over and over in preperation for my real WOD.

## 3.In-class WODs
In the beginning of the semester I refused to use AI on my real graded WODs. As time passed and I would frustratingly get stuck on one small thing, I began to use AI as the last minute tool if what I was doing wasn't working. However using AI as help for WODs seemed to help 30% of the time. It would either make it way more complicated, using things I never learned yet, or just not work. 

## 4.Essays
No, I have never used AI to write essays.

## 5.Final project
For my final project majority of the time I would use previous WOD experience videos as a reference. But when I would have merge conflict errors or some problems that were difficult for me to solve, I would run it by ChatGPT to help me debug and understand what was wrong. It would help sometimes but with the many different folders and files, it would take more time trying to explain and understand more than fixing the problem. 

## 6.Learning a concept / tutorial
I guess I would ask ChatGPT some questions time to time such as 'what does justify-context-center' do? To get a detailed understanding of what the concepts that I saw in WOD experience videos meant. I would also use it for tutorials on how to do certain things like creating buttons, how to correctly link pages, etc. For these questions ChatGPT was pretty accurate and helpful.

## 7.Answering a question in class or in Discord
I have never used AI to answer a question in class or Discord.

## 8.Asking or answering a smart-question
No I have never used AI to answer or ask a question. If I were to ask a question i never needed an AI tool for assistance.

## 9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
I've actually never used AI to give me examples. Instead I would more so use it for the actual specific question that I had. 

## 10. Explaining code
I would use this example alot in my other coding classes more than this class. I did use it a few times to understand what some new concepts were and ChatGPT breaks it down really well for me. 

## 11. Writing Code
I would use AI tools such as ChatGPT to help me write code. In particular when I was stuck on the timed WODs in class, I would ask ChatGPT to help write thethe correct portion of my code if a part wasn't working. It was pretty helpful in this task unless my code consisted of numerous pages and folders. 

## 12. Documenting Code
No I never thought of documenting code with AI

## 13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
Using Chatgpt to fix my errors was probably my most popular usage. If I had a hard time figuring out what the errors meant or how to fix them, I would use chatgpt alot to help me find out the solution. This portion was probably the most helpful in debugging and understanding what the errors meant. I would usually copy the whole error that was displayed on my terminal and ask what it meant. Or I would copy the section of the code along with the underlined error to explain what it meant and how to fix it. I used this alot during the process of my project. I also copied the terminal during the downloading processes when things were nto dowloaded correctly. It would take me step by step on what to do to fix the version, update the version, or if I did not download it correctly. Without this help I wouldn't have been able to really fix or understand any of the errors that I got into. 

## Conclusion
Overall while AI was able to help me get through this class and fix my errors, as well as teach me how to do certain things that I did not know, I think that in the long term, it has negatively effected my comprehension of knowledge. The moment I started using ChatGPT to help me on my WODs it got harder and harder for me to do them by myself. Usually because I would be needing to do the same thing that I asked ChatGPT to help me with previously. I would just be copying and pasting rather than fully figuring it out and understanding so that I could retain that memory. There were a lot of times where it was the only resource for me to get help, so I will say that I would not have been able to do a lot of the WODs or portions of downloading databases etc if it weren't for the assistance. 
I think in the real world as a software engineer it is a really good tool to help debug your code or understand what the errors mean. It would also be very an efficient source to understand what certain code snippets mean or how certain functions work. 
The main challenge with AI is that it isn't the most accurate at times in giving the correct way. There are many different solutions so sometimes I would get an out of ICS314 advanced leveled solution. As previously said, if there are a handful of files in my code, it is difficult to get an accurate response as well with different locations and links in your own project. 

There is a lot of future improvements that I would want to work on personally. The usage of AI in this class made me realize that it only gets harder and you really need to grasp the understanding of a difficult task. I think the way I used it to understand what error messages meant was very efficient, but when it came to just copying and pasting down the solution, it did not help me retain what changes I had made to solve the problem.
