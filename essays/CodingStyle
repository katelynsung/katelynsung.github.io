We are now living in a technology age. Ever since Covid hit, the usage of technology especially social media mutated. Commercials and entertainment has adapted to the usage and benefits of technology as well. I've always wanted to be in the fashion field growing up, whether it was modeling or acting in movies. I then later learned that there is so much going on behind the scenes before an actress can be seen on the screen of your phone. Thats how my interest of programming and the field of computer science started, and with that I entered my college years introduced to the world of computer science. 


Movies have gotten more realistic as were now able to watch live action versions of Animals like the Lion King, and even elements like the Ocean looking ever so real. I've still heavily wanted to incorporate this computer field and relate it to some type of fashion field. Recently I came across an out of this world commercial using alot of CGI and alien UFO ship graphics that looked so real. In the commercial the model was touching buttons on a clear screen projected in the air. I could tell lots of coding was needed for the futuristic vibe, this sparked my interest in the field of creative computational media. 

## Skills I'm hoping to develop
I'm super eager to learn more skills where I can use them in every day life and for my career path. I'm hoping to develop skills on how to make websites and create designs and animation. I want to end up being in a field where I can be a creative director in fashion and create very unique commercials. By this I hope to develop skills that will allow me to code very cool augmented reality or virtual reality backdrops and themes for fashion shows and campaigns. I hope to develop more confident programming skills, have more resiliency, try new things, and advance my creativity. Overall I want to be able to implement my coding skills to create my own personal projects rather than just homework assignments.
