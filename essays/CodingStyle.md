## My Experience with VSCode and ESLint
Recently I've used VSCode for the first time. It is definitely a big jump from previously using TypeScript Playground. I've also incorporated the usage of ESLint. ESLint is a tool that helps fix and identify errors. While I am still getting used to it, I will say that it is pretty tedious and difficult when having to constantly run specific things before starting your code. For example having to write stuff such as "npm run lint" and "nvm install" each time can be annoying. I've been running into many errors and warnings in the process which can be stressful. I am currently beginning to use a handful of files in my codes so VSCode comes in handy for that. While ESLint is annoying to have to install and prepare, I think that it is really beneficial with handling errors and suggestions. 

## Thoughts On Coding Styles
While it can be annoying to see so many red squiggly lines, I think that coding styles are so necessary. In my future career path, software engineers may have to collaborate their work and show eachother their codes. If no one is following a coding style I can see it being so hectic and difficult to understand. Coding Styles allow your code to be organized and legible. It's just like when you have to peer edit someone's hand written essay, If their handwriting is so messy and the format is all over the place, you would struggle trying to understand what the jumbled up words are saying. Overall while my coding standards are still very questionable, I think that being able to practice through VSCode and tools like ESLint will help me in breaking my horrible coding style. I think this is an important skill to have and everyone should be following coding standards.
